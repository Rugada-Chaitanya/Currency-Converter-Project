Earlier, business owners who deals with international clients or people who traveled to other countries had to manually check exchange rates and perform mathematical calculations to ensure accurate payments. This process was both time-consuming and prone to errors.

The Currency Converter application simplifies this by allowing users to convert one currency to another based on the latest exchange rates. This helps users track exchange rates and make accurate calculations. They simply need to enter the amount they want to convert and choose the target currency. The app then displays the latest exchange rates, enabling business owners and travelers to manage their international transactions more easily, knowing they are getting correct conversions.

In this project, an API is used to provide the latest currency exchange rates.

Additionally, four modules are utilized: requests, Tkinter, Pillow, and datetime.
